# Deployment customizations

This page contains various deployment customizations as it relates to creating your TFE infrastructure, and their corresponding module input variables that you may additionally set to meet your own requirements where the default module values do not suffice. That said, all of the module input variables on this page are optional.

## Load balancing

### Load balancer type

This module supports either creating a network load balancer (NLB) or an application load balancer (ALB) in front of the TFE autoscaling group. ***The default is NLB**, but the following input variable may be set to an ALB if desirable.

```hcl
lb_type = "alb"
```

### Load balancer scheme

This module supports creating a load balancer with either and `internal` or `internet-facing` load balancing scheme. **The default is `internal`**, but the following module boolean input variable may be set to configure the load balancer to be `internet-facing` (public) if desirable.

```hcl
lb_is_internal = false
```

## DNS

This module supports creating an _alias_ record in AWS Route53 for the TFE FQDN to resolve to the load balancer DNS name. To do so, the following module input variables may be set:

```hcl
create_route53_tfe_dns_record      = true
route53_tfe_hosted_zone_name       = "<example.com>"
route53_tfe_hosted_zone_is_private = true
```

>üìù Note: If `lb_is_internal` is `false`, then `route53_tfe_hosted_zone_is_private` should also be `false`. An DNS record resolving to an _internal_ load balancer should be created in a _private_ Route53 Hosted Zone, and a DNS record resolving to an _Internet-facing_ (external) load balancer should be a created in a _public_ Route53 Hosted Zone.

## KMS

If you require the use of a customer-managed key(s) (CMK) to encrypt your AWS resources, the following module input variables may be set:

```hcl
ebs_kms_key_arn   = "<ebs-kms-key-arn>"
rds_kms_key_arn   = "<rds-kms-key-arn>"
s3_kms_key_arn    = "<s3-kms-key-arn>"
redis_kms_key_arn = "<redis-kms-key-arn>"
```

## Airgap

If your TFE environment has limited to no egress connectivity to the public internet, then some additional inputs may need to be set.

### TFE application container image

By default, the [tfe_user_data](../templates/tfe_user_data.sh.tpl) (cloud-init) script will attempt to pull the TFE application container image from its publicly hosted location of `images.releases.hashicorp.com` (which is a canonical endpoint that is backed by various AWS S3 buckets across four regions). To override this default behavior and pull the TFE application container from a custom location instead, set the following inputs:

```hcl
tfe_image_repository_url      = "internal-registry.example.com"
tfe_image_name                = "example/terraform-enterprise"
tfe_image_tag                 = "v202505-1"
tfe_image_repository_username = "example-user"
tfe_image_repository_password = "SomethingSecure!"
```

If you are specifically using Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) to host the TFE application container image, the values would look something like:

```hcl
tfe_image_repository_url      = "<account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com" # ECR registry URI
tfe_image_name                = "tfe-app" # ECR repository name
tfe_image_tag                 = v202505-1
tfe_image_repository_username = "AWS"
tfe_image_repository_password = null # Set to null to use the EC2 instance profile for authentication instead of password
```

### OS software dependencies

By default, the [tfe_user_data](../templates/tfe_user_data.sh.tpl) (cloud-init) script attempts to install the required operating system software dependencies for TFE:

- `unzip` - used to unpack and install `aws-cli`
- `aws-cli` - used to fetch the required bootstrap secrets from AWS Secrets Manager
- `docker` or `podman` (depending on the value of the `container_runtime` input) - used to run the TFE application

If your TFE environment lacks egress connectivity to the official Linux package repositories, you should bake those dependencies into a custom image before deploying TFE. See the [Custom AMI](#custom-ami) section below for details.

## Custom AMI

By default, this module uses the standard AWS Marketplace image based on the value of the `ec2_os_distro` input (either `ubuntu`, `rhel`, or `al2023`). If you prefer to override this behavior and use a custom AMI, set the `ec2_ami_id` input accordingly:

```hcl
ec2_os_distro = "<os-distro>" # either 'ubuntu', 'rhel', 'al2023', or 'centos'
ec2_ami_id    = "<custom-ami-id>"
```

Ensure the value you set for `ec2_os_distro` accurately reflects the OS distribution of your custom AMI.

## Proxy

To configure a proxy for outbound HTTP and HTTPS requests, set the following inputs:

```hcl
http_proxy                  = "http://proxy.example.com:3128"
https_proxy                 = "http://proxy.example.com:3128"
additional_no_proxy         = "10.0.0.0/8,192.168.1.0/24,internal.example.com"
cidr_allow_egress_ec2_proxy = ["<proxy-ip-address/32>"] # IP address(es) of proxy server
```

This configuration applies the proxy settings at both the host level and within the TFE application containers.

### Proxy bypass

If either `http_proxy` or `https_proxy` (or both) are set, the module automatically generates a base `no_proxy` list that includes:

- `localhost`
- `127.0.0.1`
- `169.254.169.254`
- Value of `var.tfe_fqdn`
- EC2 instance private IP address
- TFE S3 bucket regional domain name (_e.g.,_ `<tfe-s3-bucket-name>.s3.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com`)
- Regional AWS Secrets Manager endpoint (_e.g.,_ `secretsmanager.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com`)

Setting `additional_no_proxy` is optional. If specified, the value is appended to this automatically generated base `no_proxy` list.

## Terraform agent container image

If you need to customize the Terraform agent container image that TFE uses to execute Terraform runs, set the following input accordingly:

```hcl
tfe_run_pipeline_image = "internal-registry.example.com/tfe-agent:latest"
```

IMPORTANT: the container registry used to host this image must support anonymous (unathenticated) image pulls, as authenticated image pulls here are currently unsupported.

## Custom user_data (startup) script

While not recommended, this module supports the use of custom `user_data` (startup) script to install TFE. To enable this behavior, set the `custom_tfe_startup_script_template` input to the filename of your custom script template.

**Requirements**:

- The file must exist in a directory named `./templates` relative to your current working directory (Terraform root)
- The filename (not the path) should be passed to `custom_tfe_startup_script_template`
- Your custom script must include all of the template variables (denoted by `${example-variable}`) used in the built-in [tfe_user_data](../templates/tfe_user_data.sh.tpl) (cloud-init) script

```hcl
custom_tfe_startup_script_template = custom_tfe_user_data.sh.tpl"
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Use with caution and at your own peril. This should only be used if you have specific needs that the built-in script cannot accommodate.
